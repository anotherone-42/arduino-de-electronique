Arduino, program to learn how to code a digital die.  
  
This program is for beginners, it generates a random number between 1 and 6 after pressing a button and then displays it, after a certain delay, on a 7-segment display. Between pressing the button and the display, a blinking effect has been provided to simulate the rolling of the die on the ground.  
  
For this project, I used:  
- an Arduino Uno,  
- two LEDs (noted ledv and ledr in the program),  
- a button,  
- a 7-segment display type 1106BW.  
- 8 resistors of 4.7k Ohms  
  
How the die works:
